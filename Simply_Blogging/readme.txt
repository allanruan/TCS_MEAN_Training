Description of steps taken for task:
To create the blog website, I first built the html files using a bootstrap example. First, I created the nav tool bar for my blog utilizing the fixed nav bar example and edited it to include the desired pages that I wanted in my page. These are the About, Contact, Blog, Home, and AddBlog pages. These pages leveraged different patterns from bootstrap. The about us paged used the starter template and modified to include the about us section. The Contact and AddBlog was created from the bootstrap fixed nav bar page, which I added a container to include the contact form and the blog post forms. These forms include validation checks using javascript. The contact form validates that the name, email, mobile phone, and inquiry were included and was in the correct format. Next, the blog page leveraged the containers from album example. Then the home page was built from the bootstrap carousel example. The CSS properties of each example was included in the mystyle.css, where I have modified some styling in order to bring out the aesthetics of the page. These included modifying the colors, font weight, and the way the images were displayed. This had to be done in a way that different selectors were not affected as similar tags were used between the pages. The use of class specific selectors was utilized to achieve this.
